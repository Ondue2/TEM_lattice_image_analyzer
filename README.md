# TEM_analyzer

This Jupyter notebook, written in Python, extracts atomic coordinates from a TEM image. This program is designed for a lattice structure. The purpose of this program is to detect subtle structural disorders or symmetry breaking in TEM images. You will need to feed lattice information to the program. You can follow the cells to analyze your TEM image.

The research using this code has been published at https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c08312.
